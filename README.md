### Concept
- Nomai Catalog is one of the projects of Saiph Operation, that intead to improve my CPP and OOP abilities.
- Its a simple project to persist and read about cosmic objects of the universe through the CMD(lets stay simple, but the structure is prepared for something bigger), like Stars and Planets.
